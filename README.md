# Frontend for BFHL Challenge

This React frontend allows users to submit JSON data through a form, which is then sent to a backend API hosted on Heroku for processing. The processed results are displayed on the frontend, and users can filter the response using a multi-select dropdown. The app is deployed on Vercel for live usage.
